        question_2:
          q: 'How are the ballots counted?'
          a: '<p>Ballots returned by mail are counted in the same manner as in the existing District of Columbia absentee voting process. Local election officials receive your return envelope with a marked ballot and attestation. The attestation is reviewed to confirm voter eligibility. After attestation review, the return envelope and secure ballot envelope are separated. The printed ballots are either scanned and counted or counted by hand.</p><p>When your ballot is returned through the Internet, the ballot and attestation are transmitted through the Internet using secure protocols. Once the ballot and attestation are received, the ballot file is encrypted (similar to a security envelope) and stored so that election officials cannot read the marked ballot when reviewing the attestation. Local election officials confirm voter eligibility, separate approved ballots from attestations (similar to the paper process), and then decrypt the ballot (similar to removing from a paper security envelope). The ballots are then printed and counted.</p>'

          q: "Isn't there a risk that ballots may be counted more than once?"
          a: '<p>The Digital Vote-by-Mail Service and Digital Ballot Return Project count ballots in the same way as  current services for overseas voters. In both cases (physical and electronic ballot submission), all ballots are printed and then counted.

          q: 'What happens if I send in more than one ballot?'

Eligible overseas voters will receive voting materials by mail as well as instructions for the new Digital Vote-by-Mail Service. Voters can elect which service to use to complete and return their ballots.</p>'
        question_5:

        question_6:
          q: 'Can I return my ballot both by mail and online?'

          a: '<p>By law, voters must be informed when their ballots have arrived and are ready to be counted.  If you return your ballot by mail you will receive a confirmation message that your ballot is completed. If you return your ballot via the Internet, your ballot is received immediately. A message will confirm date and time ballot was sent. In both cases, you can find out the status of your ballot <a href="#">here</a>.</p>'
        question_8:
          q: 'How can I be certain my vote will be counted?'
          a: '<p>Ballots returned through the Digital Vote-by-Mail Service and Digital Ballot Return Pilot Project are processed in exactly the same way as all Vote By Mail ballots. When a ballot and attestation are received, the ballot file is encrypted (similar to a security envelope), and stored. The attestation document is reviewed to confirm voter eligibility. Approved ballots are separated from linked attestations (similar to the paper process), decrypted (like removing a ballot from the security envelope) and printed. Marked ballots are then counted by hand or scanned to be counted.</p>'

        question_4:
          q: 'What is an attestation form?'
          a: "<p>The attestation form affirms that you are eligible to vote with an absentee ballot. If you are returning your ballot by mail, you must read the attestation on the web page and check the check box to confirm it. Then download, print, and include the printed attestation form with your completed ballot. If you have elected digital ballot return, you must read the attestation on the web page and check the check box to confirm it. Your attestation will get returned to the BOEE automatically. You can also optionally download and print the attestation PDF.</p>"

        question_4:
          q: 'What happens if I forget to save my ballot?'
          a: "<p>Your ballot is not automatically saved. You must save it after you have marked it by selecting Save As from in the File Menu of your PDF reader. This is an important step.

          q: "I can't find my ballot. Where is it?"
          a: "<p>You will need to find your ballot to either print and return it by mail or upload it. It is a good idea to save the marked ballot on your desktop so that you can easily locate it.

        question_2:
          q: 'What is a security envelope?'
          a: '<p>A security envelope is the envelope in which you place your marked ballot. You can use any letter-sized mailing envelope. You should not write your name (or create any other marks) on the security envelope.</p>'
        question_3:
          q: 'Why is it important to secure the ballot in a separate envelope?'
          a: '<p>A security envelope ensures that your marked ballot is anonymous. Your marked ballot and the attestation confirming your identity are separated in the ballot counting process.</p>'
        question_4:
          q: 'When mailing election materials to my state or territory, do I have to pay postage?'
          a: '<p>When mailed from any U.S. post office, U.S. embassy or consulate, or APO/FPO mail facility, the hardcopy ballot form is postage-paid.

Ensure that your form is postmarked (see postmarking instructions below) and sent to arrive before the deadline: 5 pm EST, November 2, 2010. You must pay postage if materials are mailed from a non-U.S. postal facility. </p>'
        question_5:
          q: 'What is a postmark and how do I make sure I get one?'
          a: "<p>A postmark is a postal marking made on a piece of mail indicating the date and time that the item was accepted by the postal service. Postmarks are used to determine if voting materials have been mailed by state deadlines. Due to varying mail pick up times, the day you 'mail' your election mail may not be the day the postal facility postmarks it.</p><p>You may ask the mail clerk to hand stamp the election material so that the date is clearly visible. In certain situations a handwritten postmark and signature from you or a notarizing official may be sufficient. </p>"

        question_1:
          q: 'Is how I voted secret?'
          a: '<p>Yes. Secrecy of the ballot is mandated by law and is upheld in all elections. The ballots returned in the Digital Vote-by-Mail service and the Digital Ballot Return Pilot Project are treated exactly the same as all other Vote-by-Mail ballots. Ballot secrecy is maintained.</p>'
        question_2:
          q: 'Can how I vote get tracked back to me?'
          a: '<p>No. No election official can trace a ballot back to a particular voter.</p>'
        question_3:
          q: 'How does my ballot remain anonymous?'
          a: "<h3>Return by Mail</h3><p>When you return your ballot by mail, you first place your marked ballot in an inner security envelope. The security envelope is placed in an outer return envelope with your attestation for mailing back to the BOEE.</p><p>The outer return envelope that contains your attestation with your name and address is opened and separated from the inner security envelope that contains the voted ballot.</p><p>Before the inner security envelope may be opened, it is mixed in with many other security envelopes. This allows the ballot to remain anonymous. Only once the security envelope is mixed in with other security envelopes may the ballot be removed. This maintains the secrecy of the ballot.</p><h3>Return via Internet</h3><p>When your ballot is returned through the Internet, the ballot and attestation are transmitted through the Internet using secure protocols. Once the ballot and attestation are received, the ballot file is encrypted (similar to a security envelope) and stored so that election officials cannot read the marked ballot when reviewing the attestation. Local election officials confirm voter eligibility, separate approved ballots from attestations (similar to the paper process), and then decrypt the ballot (similar to removing from a paper security envelope). The ballots are then printed and counted. From the time a ballot is printed, it is no longer linked to a voter.</p>"
        question_4:
          q: 'How does the Vote-by-Mail service secure the ballot transmission?'
          a: '<p>Ballots are transmitted through secure SSL connections. Security methods for ballot transmission are the same as security methods currently used for online banking. The two-factor authentication process includes voter name and zip, and the alphanumeric PIN supplied by the BOEE.</p>'
        question_5:
          q: 'Is there a chance my ballot could be intercepted?'
          a: '<p>Although the ballot submission process is secure, there is risk that a ballot could be intercepted. Any Internet activity is subject to social engineering techniques currently used to exploit current web security techniques and fool users&#151for example, Phishing.</p>'
